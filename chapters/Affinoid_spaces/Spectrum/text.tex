\section{Spectrum}

    % Let \(A\) be an integral \(\kk\)-algebra with \(\kk\) complete non-archimedean algebraically closed field.
    % For every \(\frakm \in \Spec A\), the absolute value on \(A/\frakm \cong \kk\) induces a multiplicative semi-norm on \(A\) by \(|f|_\frakm := |f \mod \frakm|\) for each \(f \in A\).

    % Suppose that we have an absolute value \(\|\cdot\|\) on \(\KK = \Frac A\) extending that on \(\kk\).
    % It induces a norm on \(A\) by restriction, denoted by \(\|\cdot\|_\eta\).

    % Then we can ``deform'' \(\|\cdot\|_\eta\) to \(|\cdot|_\frakm\) as follows:

    Let \(\kk\) be a spherically complete non-archimedean field which is algebraically closed and \(A = \kk[T]\).
    We want to consider the ``analytic structure'' on \(\mSpec A\).
    However, unlike the complex case, the set \(\mSpec A\) is totally disconnected with respect to the topology induced by the absolute value on \(\kk\) (\cref{prop:ultra-metric_space_is_totally_disconnected}).
    To overcome this difficulty, Berkovich uses multiplicative semi-norms to ``fill in the gaps'' between the points in \(\mSpec A\), leading to the notion of the spectrum of a Banach ring.

    We first consider the local model.
    Hence we should consider the Tate algebra \(\kk\{T\}\) instead of the polynomial ring \(\kk[T]\).

\subsection{Definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:spectrum_of_Banach_rings}
        Let \(R\) be a Banach ring.
        The \emph{spectrum} \(\scrM(R)\) of \(R\) is defined as the set of all multiplicative semi-norms on \(R\) that are bounded with respect to the given norm on \(R\).
        For every point \(x \in \scrM(R)\), we denote the corresponding multiplicative semi-norm by \(|\cdot|_x\).
        We equip \(\scrM(R)\) with the weakest topology such that for each \(f \in R\), the evaluation map \(\scrM(R) \to \bbR_{\geq 0}\), defined by \(x \mapsto |f|_x\eqqcolon f(x)\), is continuous.
    \end{definition}
    
    \begin{definition}\label{def:pullback_of_ring_homomorphism_of_banach_rings_on_spectrum}
        Let \(\varphi: R \to S\) be a bounded ring homomorphism of Banach rings.
        The \emph{pullback} map \(\scrM(\varphi): \scrM(S) \to \scrM(R)\) is defined by \(\scrM(\varphi)(x) = x \circ \varphi: f \mapsto |\varphi(f)|_x\) for each \(x \in \scrM(S)\).

    \end{definition}

    % For \(x \in \scrM(R)\), \Yang{the kernel of the multiplicative semi-norm \(|\cdot|_x\) is a closed prime ideal of \(R\)}, denoted by \(\wp_x\).
    % The semi-norm \(|\cdot|_x\) induces a multiplicative norm on the residue field \(\rkk(x) = \Frac(R/\wp_x)\), denoted by \(|\cdot|_{x}\) as well. 

    % \begin{definition}\label{def:character_of_banach_rings}
    %     Let \(R\) be a Banach ring.
    %     A \emph{character} of \(R\) is a bounded ring homomorphism \(\chi: R \to K\), where \(K\) is a completed field.
    %     Two characters \(\chi_1: R \to K_1\) and \(\chi_2: R \to K_2\) are said to be \emph{equivalent} if there exists a commutative diagram of bounded ring homomorphisms
    %     \[
    %         \begin{tikzcd}
    %             & R \arrow[dl, "\chi_1"'] \arrow[dr, "\chi_2"] \arrow[d] & \\
    %             K_1 & K \arrow[l,hook'] \arrow[r,hook] & K_2
    %         \end{tikzcd}

    \begin{definition}
        Let \(R\) be a Banach ring.

    \paragraph{Spectrum of Tate algebra in one variable} Let \(\kk\) be a complete non-archimedean field, and let \(A = \kk\{T/r\}\).
    We list some types of points in the spectrum \(\scrM(A)\).

    For each \(a \in \kk\) with \(|a| \leq r\), we have the \emph{type I} point \(x_a\) corresponding to the evaluation at \(a\), i.e., \(|f|_{x_a} := |f(a)|\) for each \(f \in A\).
    For each closed disk \(E = E(a,s) := \{b \in \kk : |b - a| \leq s\}\) with center \(a \in \kk\) and radius \(s \leq r\), we have the point \(x_{a,s}\) corresponding to the multiplicative semi-norm defined by
    \[ |f|_{x_E} := \sup_{b \in E(a,s)} |f(b)| \]
    for each \(f \in A\).
    If \(s \in |\kk^\times|\), then the point \(x_E\) is called a \emph{type II} point; otherwise, it is called a \emph{type III} point.
    
    Let \(\{E^{(s)}\}_s\) be a family of closed disks in \(\kk\) such that \(E^{(s)}\) is of radius \(s\), \(E^{(s_1)} \subsetneq E^{(s_2)}\) for any \(s_1 < s_2\) and \(\bigcap_s E^{(s)} = \emptyset\).
    Then we have the point \(x_{\{E^{(s)}\}}\) corresponding to the multiplicative semi-norm defined by
    \[ |f|_{x_{\{E^{(s)}\}}} := \inf_s |f|_{x_{E^{(s)}}} \]
    for each \(f \in A\).
    Such a point is called a \emph{type IV} point.
