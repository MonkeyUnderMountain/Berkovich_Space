\section{Valued Fields}

\subsection{Setup}

    Let \(\kk\) be a field.
    A \emph{norm} on \(\kk\) is a function \(\|\cdot\|: \kk \to \bbR_+\) such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item (non-degeneracy) \(\|x\| = 0 \iff x = 0\);
        \item (normalization) \(\|1\| = 1\);
        \item (multiplicativity) \(\forall x,y \in \kk, \|xy\| = \|x\|\|y\|\);
        \item (triangle inequality) \(\forall x,y \in \kk, \|x + y\| \leq \|x\| + \|y\|\).
    \end{itemize}
    A norm is called \emph{non-Archimedean} if it satisfies the strong triangle inequality
    \[
        \|x + y\| \leq \max\{\|x\|, \|y\|\}.
    \]
    A field \(\kk\) equipped with a non-Archimedean norm is called a \emph{non-Archimedean field}.
    A norm induces a metric \(d(x,y) = \|x - y\|\) on \(\kk\).
    With this metric, \(\kk\) is a metric space.
    We say \(\kk\) is \emph{complete} if it is complete as a metric space.
