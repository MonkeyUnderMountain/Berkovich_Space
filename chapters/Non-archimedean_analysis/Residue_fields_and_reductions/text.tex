\section{Residue fields and reductions}

    \begin{theorem}[Hensel's lemma]\label{prop:Hensel_lemma}
        Let \((\kk,\|\cdot\|)\) be a complete non-archimedean field and \(f(T) \in \kk^\circ[T]\) be a monic polynomial.
        Suppose that the reduction \(\widetilde{f}(T) \in \calk_\kk[T]\) of \(f(T)\) factors as
        \[ \widetilde{f}(T) = g(T) h(T), \]
        where \(g(T), h(T) \in \calk_\kk[T]\) are monic polynomials that are coprime in \(\calk_\kk[T]\).
        Then there exist monic polynomials \(G(T), H(T) \in \kk^\circ[T]\) such that
        \[ f(T) = G(T) H(T), \]
        and the reductions \(\widetilde{G}(T), \widetilde{H}(T) \in \calk_\kk[T]\) of \(G(T), H(T)\) are \(g(T), h(T)\) respectively.
